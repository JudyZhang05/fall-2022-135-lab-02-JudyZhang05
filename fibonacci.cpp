At two billions the fibonacci sequence starts to diverge from what they should be; becoming large negative
numbers and no longer following the fibonacci sequence. What's happening is that c++ is reaching it's value
of INT_MAX which is around 2 billon, thus the numbers are diverging to combat that. */
